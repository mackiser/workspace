# workspace

### Overview
Hello all, this is my java workspace for my intro-level computer science class I am currently taking at my university. Most of these projects are extremely basic, but I like keeping them on record so I can access them anywhere.

### Licensing
None of this code is licensed so you can use all of it or parts of it however you like. But it would be nice to give me some credit somewhere in your code.

### Contact
If you would like to ask any questions or just wanna talk you can contact me here:
