### Overview
Hello all, this is my java workspace for my intro-level computer science class I am currently taking at my university. Most of these projects are extremely basic, but I like keeping them on record so I can access them anywhere.

### Licensing
None of this code is licensed so you can use all of it or parts of it however you like. But if you are a nice person it would be nice to give me some credit somewhere in your code.

### Contact
If you would like to ask any questions or just wanna talk you can contact me here:
