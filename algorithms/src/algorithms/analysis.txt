Algorithm Analysis

1.  the "Factoring time all numbers up to square root" method outperformed the others most of the time

2. the "Factoring time using just primes up to square root" method performed much better with numbers that had less digits

3. The last two algorithms were much slower than the others, and I think this is caused by the method having ot run through the while loop a lot of times in order to return a value

4. There seems to be a steady increase in the time it takes to factor as the digits in the number increase.

5. they generally look linear to me
